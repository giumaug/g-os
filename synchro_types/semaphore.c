//CESATI AND BOVE explain how to protect kernel data structures at pag 216 parag. 5.3.
//Intresting also is chapter 5 of Linux Device Drivers.
//With count zero init mutex (formally process holding mutex should be the only permitted to release mutex )
//Process holding mutex or semaphore can sleep.Process holding spinlock can't.(Performance problems or deadlock)
//Spinlock are useless in uniprocessor system without preemption.In uniprocessor system with preemption spinlock 
//needs to disable interrupt otherwise deadlock:if i use a spinlock and interrupt is fired when spinlock 
//is held system get deadlocked.
//In multiporcessor system spinlock needs to disable local interrupt.
//If the spinlook is used only in race between exception it is still possible to have
//interrupt enabled.Linux offer two variant of spinlock.
